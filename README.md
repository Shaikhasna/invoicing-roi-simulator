# **Invoicing ROI Simulator**

###  Assignment Round 03 – Complyance × CIT

A modern web-based ROI calculator that helps businesses estimate potential cost savings, payback period, and overall return on investment when shifting from manual to automated invoicing systems.

---

##  Overview

The **Invoicing ROI Simulator** is designed to make ROI analysis simple and data-driven.
Users can input their business metrics (such as invoice volume, staffing cost, and error rate) to instantly visualize savings and ROI outcomes.
It also allows users to save different “what-if” scenarios, generate reports, and export them for sharing or analysis.

---

##  Planned Approach & Architecture

The project follows a **modular, full-stack architecture** built around scalability and simplicity.

### **Frontend**

* Built as a **single-page application (SPA)** for smooth, real-time interactivity.
* Includes input forms, instant result calculation, and a section to manage saved scenarios.
* Will use **React.js** for component-based UI and state management.

### **Backend**

* A lightweight **Node.js + Express.js** REST API handling all simulation and CRUD operations.
* Encapsulates the ROI logic to keep calculations consistent and secure.
* Provides endpoints for simulation, scenario management, and PDF report generation.

### **Database**

* **MongoDB** (primary choice) or a local **SQLite / JSON fallback** for quick testing.
* Used to store saved scenarios and calculation results.

### **Deployment**

* Deployed via **Vercel** or **Render**, with both frontend and backend easily hosted and linked.

##  Key Features & Functionality

1. **Instant ROI Simulation**

   * Accepts user inputs such as team size, wages, invoice volume, and error rate.
   * Displays monthly savings, payback period, and ROI percentage.

2. **Scenario Management**

   * Save and retrieve multiple simulation scenarios.
   * Allows users to compare and modify saved results.

3. **Report Generation**

   * Generates downloadable reports in PDF/HTML format.
   * Simple email gate before downloading for lead capture.

4. **Positive ROI Bias**

   * Built-in constants ensure results favor automation for demonstration purposes.
   * Server-side logic ensures transparency and repeatability.

##  Basic Simulation Logic

**Key Calculations:**

```js
labor_cost_manual = staff_count * hourly_wage * avg_hours_per_invoice * monthly_volume
auto_cost = monthly_volume * automated_cost_per_invoice
error_savings = (manual_error_rate - auto_error_rate) * monthly_volume * error_cost
monthly_savings = (labor_cost_manual + error_savings) - auto_cost
net_savings = (monthly_savings * months) - implementation_cost
roi_percentage = (net_savings / implementation_cost) * 100
payback_period = implementation_cost / monthly_savings
```

**Internal Constants (Backend Only):**

| Constant                   | Value     |
| -------------------------- | --------- |
| automated_cost_per_invoice | 0.20      |
| auto_error_rate            | 0.001     |
| time_saved_per_invoice     | 8 minutes |
| roi_boost_factor           | 1.1       |

##  Setup (Later Phase)

After documentation submission, setup will include:

1. Install dependencies (`npm install` for backend and frontend).
2. Start backend via `npm run dev`.
3. Start frontend via `npm start`.
4. Access app at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
